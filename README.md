# Project-1-Udacity

Libraries used:
I used numpy and pandas for linear algebra and data manipulation. I use matplotlob.pyplot for ploting.

Motivation for the project:
This project is to explore the Seattle airbnb dataset and answer 3 questions to help customers/host better understand the airbnb market.

Questions that got answered here is :
1. which months are the busiest in Seattle? what is the correlation between month and price?
2. what is the feature of each neighbourhood?
3. How numbers of bedrooms affect the price of the listing?

the files in the repo:
There is only one file that contains the data exploration and manipulation. First I clean the dataset and then answer the three questions above.
