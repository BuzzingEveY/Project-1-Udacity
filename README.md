# Project-1-Udacity

## Libraries used:
I used numpy and pandas for linear algebra and data manipulation. I use matplotlob.pyplot for ploting.

## Motivation for the project:
This project is to explore the Seattle airbnb dataset and answer 3 questions to help customers/host better understand the airbnb market.

## Questions that got answered here is :
1. which months are the busiest in Seattle? what is the correlation between month and price?
2. what is the feature of each neighbourhood?
3. How numbers of bedrooms affect the price of the listing?

## the files in the repo:
I have gathered the Seattle AirBnB data provided by Kaggle here (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). The following files are being used: 
Listings.csv - includes full descriptions of listings and average review score 
Reviews.csv - includes unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments 
Calendar.csv - includes listing id and the price and availability for that day.

##Summary of the finding
1. which months are the busiest in Seattle? what is the correlation between month and price?

It looks like the first few months of the year experience lower prices with a quick spike in the summer where the average prices jump above 100 and then higher prices towards the end of the year. This could possibly relate to tourists preferring to travel during the summer/fall seasons and during the holidays which the hosts in Seattle certainly take advantage of.

2. what is the feature of each neighbourhood?

By using the analysis table, we can have a clear view of the feature of each neighbourhood. For people like coffee shops, they can just search coffee shop in this table and we can provide a list of neighbourhood that they can visit or stay at. For example, 'Broadway' neighbourhood is great for walking and coffee shops.

3. How numbers of bedrooms affect the price of the listing?

It can be analyzed that with the increase in the number of bedrooms price of listing increases. Although, it depends upon the neighbourhood as well.So this analysis gives us data points that the prices of listings on Airbnb depends upon the room type, property type, number of bedrooms and neighbourhood.
